### **Description**
Travel Guide is an android application developed in an open source environment. The application is designed to serve the purpose of providing tourist attractions, hotels, restaurants at a chosen location.

The Application is developed in Java.

The Application uses Goolge Places API.

Users enter their choice of location and radius within to display tourist attractions. The application uses Google Places API to gather the tourist attractions at the given place. The Google Places API request returns an XML file, which is parsed to fetch the required fields. The fields displayed in the App are "Name of the Attraction", "Address of the attraction" and "the rating of the attraction". The App displays approximately around "20" attractions for a given location. 
    The Application is developed to support Spanish language.

### **Future Enhancements**
We would like to provide
 
-- A favourties page, where users would be able to save their favourite attractions.

-- A field that would return the distance from the current location to the tourist attraction, and also the phone number of the attraction.

-- An option to show directions to the chosen attraction from the current location.
